    "b. This distribution is most likely consistent with the Poisson process. Chipmunks only occur in discrete values, meaning that you wouldn't see a fraction of a chipmunk; they only occur in whole number values. Chipmunk most likely also act independently, meaning one chipmunk occurence doesn't influence other occurences. There aren't nearly enough trials, but it's possible to gather more daily chipmunk observations. We see how most data sets are 3 or 4, which is around the mean, and there is fewer data points further (6 and 1 chipmunks). This fits the bell-like shape of a Poisson distribution."
